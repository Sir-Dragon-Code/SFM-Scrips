# SFM-Scrips
## An unofficial repository for SuperFactoryManager Scripts

Want to help? Create a Fork, add the scripts you have (please put them under either an existing folder for a modpack, or create the folder) and then create a pull request.
Either me or another maintainer will review them / test them, and then add them

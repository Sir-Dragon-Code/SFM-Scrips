# SFM-Scrips
## An unofficial repository for SuperFactoryManager Scripts

Want to help? Create a Fork, add the scripts you have (please put them under either an existing folder for a modpack, or create the folder) and then create a pull request.
Either me or another maintainer will review them / test them, and then add them

For structure, Make the code files in Markdown (Or mention that you dont know markdown, and I will add it myself)

Structure:

\## [Title]

\```

\## comment to explain the function

then the function itself

\```

which ends up looking like this

## SFM Script
```
## This script does SFM Stuff
EVERY 420 TICKS DO
  SOMETHING
END
```

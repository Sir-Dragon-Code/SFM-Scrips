## Draconic Crafting
## This script is setup with AE2 blocking mode in mind, in which the AE2 pattern provider is set to a barrel/chest on block until primary crafting result is obtained

EVERY 20 TICKS DO
  INPUT FROM Materials
  OUTPUT RETAIN 1 TO Core
  OUTPUT RETAIN 1 TO Injector
FORGET
  INPUT FROM Core
  OUTPUT TO Provider
END

## If the source is an energy cube, sides are needed (ex. TOP SIDE after FeSource, and set energy cube to output to top)
EVERY TICK DO
  INPUT fe:: FROM FeSource
  OUTPUT fe:: TO Injector
END
